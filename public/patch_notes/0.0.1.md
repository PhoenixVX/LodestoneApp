## 0.0.1
- Needed to commit this to SOME repo so it isn't just sitting locally on my machine.
  - Also so that people can actually contribute
  - There's probably a million bugs
  - Save loading works but exporting doesn't.
  - Placeholders everywhere
- Nothing has been translated yet (was all done before I started on translations)
- Codebase is very messy. (Also this was originally my FIRST time doing anything actually important with Svelte)
